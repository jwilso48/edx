* I. reveries; passions
** structure
- sonata form
- melody at start is from childhood song that was lost
- explosion when he sees beloved, then idee fixe
- idee fixe is main theme of first movement
- structure: A(I) B(V) A(I) B(V) dev A(V) tr B(I) dev A(I) coda | coda
- (I) is the home key
** orchestration
- orchestration: take instruments of orchestra and putting them in new
  combinations (berlioz is a master of this)
- ex: violins and basses doing call and response with fluttering,
  heartbeat instrumentation to make complete chord, taken from idee
  fixe
** developmental sections
- movement ends with slow chords, contrasts with lively movement thus far
      - reminiscent of 'amen' coda that ends most protestant hymns
- one utilizes the chromatic scale to create chaos and have us lose our place
- second one creates counterpoint with lower instruments, but hard to listen
  to bc of soaring oboe melody
- berlioz has done a great job of making a symphony based almost entirely on
  one theme
* the waltz in 1830
- mozart's day: dance movement = minuet; beethoven's day: dance movement =
  sped up minuet = scherzo
- berlioz: dance movement = ballroom dance of his own time = *waltz*
- waltz at the time was racy, contemporary dance ("something that you don't
  want your daughters to do")
- spin around til disoriented and step thru partner's legs(!!!)
- very cutting edge dance
